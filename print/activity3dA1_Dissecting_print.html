<li><p>What factors did you (or your agency) consider in that decision?</p></li>
<li><p>What quantitative or qualitative data informed the decision or was disregarded?</p></li>
<li><p>What alternative consequences could have resulted from the decision? Who was involved with the decision?</p></li>
<li><p>After the decision was made, did events unfold as anticipated?</p></li>
<li><p>If not, what did happen, and why do you think it happened the way it did?</p></li>
