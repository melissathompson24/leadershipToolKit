<p>Construct a professional development plan for an individual employee, unit, or program.</p>
<p>Carefully consider organizational goals as well as individual needs. Assess practice strengths as well as challenge areas to construct a plan most relevant to the individual, unit, or program. Structure the plan to designate goals and activities over a 12-month period.</p>
<p>Respond to the reflection questions in Worksheet 3g.A2, and then use the plan template to construct your plan based upon an analysis of the individual, unit, or program area’s professional development needs. As appropriate, involve others in the discussion of professional development needs.</p>
<p>This worksheet can also be used to construct a personal development plan (see <a href="http://toolkit.ncwwi.org/activity5aA1_PersonalDevelopment.html">Domain 5 - Activity 5a.A1 Personal Professional Development</a>).</p>
